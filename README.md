# Week3 | Words of Wisdom
Code your way to wisdom by devising an effective way to introduce powerful quotes into your life.

## üìÉ Description:
Quotes remind us of the valuable wisdom and advice we have come across in life. This week, let your creations be ones that inspire to let us perspire. Fetch quotes from a file provided or from an API or a website you want to scrap and display them in such a way that they are most impactful; to YOU.

## üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Rules:
Whether it is a random quote fetcher, a daily quote shower, a live wallpaper for your phone or computer, or a bot to ping you with words of wisdom each morning, put your code skills to inspirational use and get creative as you create a reminder of timeless wisdom.

## ‚ú® Variation:
Live wallpapers, option to choose categories, mark favorite, incorporate a suitable image as a background, read it aloud, relate it with the life of the person it is quoted from, +.

## üí° Where to start? (Ideas)
It‚Äôs always Input, Process, Output.
- Let you start by loading a list of quotes. You could load the **[Quotes.csv](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week3/blob/main/Quotes.csv)** provided as your source.
- See how easily you could display a quote and its author on the screen.

## ü•® Twists
- Timing is everything. It is often helpful to let people search for a quote using the author or a certain topic.

## ‚è≥ Submissions:
- Submission of this challenge, just like all of the Weekly Coder‚Äôs challenges, is to be submitted within 36 hours after its post. And so, Sunday morning 12:00 LT.
